Keep the right order for running the code!

01_country_selection_&_split.R
    -> country selection from global data
    -> due to a lack of computing capacity, most data were calculated country by country and thus split from the global dataset
    
02_nutritional_supply.R
    -> calculation of the nutritional supply per country 
    -> calculation of the share in nutritional supply, which is produced domestically (to depict trade patterns) per country

03_nutritional_demand.R 
    -> calculation of the nutritional requirements per country 
    -> contains basic assumptions, links, advice for adjusting in regional differences
    -> better readable (but not runable) version: nutritional_demand.Rmd
  
04_fulfilled_nutritional_demand.R
     -> calculation of the fulfilled nutritional requirements per country &
     -> calculatiion of the share in fulfilled nutritional supply, which is produced domestically per country
     -> Then: each to one global dataframe
 
 05_diversity.R
      -> calculation of each crop diversity metric (Richness, inverse Simpson diversity, Asynchrony) per country
      -> Then to one global dataframe
      
 06_variables.R
       -> Adding and preparing temperature and precepitation var, derived bei egli (2020)
       -> Adding warefare, livestock, fertilizer, irrigation, gdp_per_capita data
       -> Adding Region information using regions from SDGs classification
       -> Make one global table containing all variables for analysis
       
  07_analysis.R
